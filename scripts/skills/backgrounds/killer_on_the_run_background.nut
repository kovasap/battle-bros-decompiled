There is a crime behind them, but also a sense of humanity, as if he knows he has done wrong and is looking to make amends. | Mud stands up to his legs. He\'s been running for a long time. His hands tremble, too, for his legs run from what his hands have done. | They say he killed his newborn daughter, having always wanted a son instead. | Some believe he struck down a man in self-defense. | Being blackmailed with scandalous information, it\'s hard to blame the man for what he has done.} {Even if he has done wrong, a party of killers could use a man such as he. But can the man be trusted? | %name%\'s eyes skirt from yours. When you ask how he is with a weapon, he mumbles about only having to hit \'the man\' once. | A man of %name%\'s physique could be useful, but how much can you depend upon a man whose former life was one of being on the run? | The man chamfers on his fingernails like a beaver would a tree. He\'s jumpy, but maybe that\'s a good thing in this world. | Mercenary bands are just the thing for a man like him.}";
