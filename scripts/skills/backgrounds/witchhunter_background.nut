With his assortment of exotic tools he has a great deal of experience in getting people to confess in agony their sinful liaisons with demons and devils under terrible torture. | He refers to himself as a Witchhunter, but only superstitious fools would believe this and fall for his preposterous tales. | A Witchhunter he calls himself, and he claims to have seen horrors from beyond that would drive a lesser man insane. | After his arrival in %townname%, rumors spread that he was on the hunt for devil worshippers and creatures of the night, but no one knew what the real purpose of his visit was. | In %townname% he killed an elderly woman and was thrown into the dungeon. As it turned out, the woman was responsible for the abduction and death of 3 infants, and so he was set free again. | For nights on end he sat in %townname%\'s pub, silently studying every patron like a bird of prey circling above, his crossbow never far away. It didn\'t sit well with the residents  but they didn\'t dare approach him.} {By now most of the local folks want %name% to be gone rather sooner than later and would happily see him join a travelling mercenary company. | It seems that whatever his mission was is now accomplished and so %name% offers his service as a mercenary. | It is somewhat obvious that %name% is not easily scared and he also knows how to handle a crossbow. Nobody was therefore surprised as he approached a mercenary company that was hiring. | Now, a mercenary company would be just the tool he needed to fulfill his personal quest against the evil from the world beyond. | Most people would be glad to get rid of him.}";
