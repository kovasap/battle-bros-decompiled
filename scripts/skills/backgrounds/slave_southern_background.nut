He worked as a traveling merchant until nomads ambushed his caravan. The nomads took him to a Vizier, pretending the man a criminal, and sold him as a hunted man. | Spotted for his handsomeness, %name% was kidnapped off the streets of %randomcitystate% and sold straight to a manipulative Vizier. He does not speak much of what all happened, but there is a sense manual labor was not his sole duty. | So great the religious transgressions of his predecessors, %name% was born into an indebted family, and it is uncertain how far back into his ancestry you must go before a truly free man would be found. | Desperate to save his family from generational debt, %name% sold himself into indentured servitude to ensure his wife and children have a life to live for themselves. | %name% swears he is from the north, but the deserts of the south have left him darkly tanned and, frankly, you\'ve not much reason to believe the words of a former prisoner of war no matter where he\'s from. | A once sea-farer, %name% spent years as an oarmen traveling from harbor to harbor to drive the goods of opulent merchants. Those who gave him to you stated he has a criminal past in piracy. | %name% was accused of ravishing an old woman and was given the option of execution or lifelong servitude. | Caught stealing from a fruit stall, %name% was pressed into lifelong servitude. | Fornications with \'non-women\' led to %name%\'s submission to servitude per the rules of the city-state in which he broke the laws. It was either that or become a eunuch, and you can hardly blame him for choosing the hard labor in this case.} {The hardships of his life, rather quaintly, may serve as an excellent cast from which to mold a proper mercenary. | His servitude no doubt made the man formidable in appearance, though it may be hard to say where his mind is at being what is essence an indentured sellsword. | Slaves for warriors are a usual sight in the southern cities and %name% might serve as a useful, albeit enslaved, sellsword yet. | You hope %name% could make a sound sellsword, but you have the feeling his primary allegiance is to that which any man wishes to taste: freedom.}";
