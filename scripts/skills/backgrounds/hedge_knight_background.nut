When the lord refused to pay, %name% killed him, too. | The hedge knight has spent many nights sleeping peacefully beneath a pale moon - and just as many days killing ruthlessly beneath a shining sun.} {Always on the hunt for more crowns, the company of sellswords seemed like a good fit. | Too terrifying to be employed for long, %name% seeks the company of men who will not piss themselves when he grabs a weapon. | Tired of killing jousters and lords, as well as women and children, %name% sees mercenary work as something of a vacation. | War has apparently gotten in the way of %name%\'s jousting career.
