He rapidly grew through the ranks and managed to buy his way out of the pits and into whatever \'freedom\' one could find after such a life. | A crowd-favorite, %name%\'s time as a gladiator ended after a \'pardon\' by his wealthy sponsors. But in early retirement he found his life unfulfilled. | Successful killers such as %name% can buy their way to freedom, though the bloodlust has yet to leave the man. | %name% was involved in a \'diving\' incident and received a year long ban from the pits. | But gladiators like %name% are not just popular with the public, but particularly with the womenfolk. A raunchy tryst with a nobleman\'s wife led to the fighter being spirited away under the cover of night lest he be castrated. | A pit\'s most popular fighter is usually a blend of murderous handsomeness, and a man such as %name% was only the former. Dispirited by the lack of fame he thought he had earned, he purchased his freedom and departed the blood sport.} {Gladiators usually cross from fighting pit to fighting pit, so a sturdy, well skilled fighter such as %name% is rare to find in the wild. Yet here he stands, albeit with enough scars to make a flagellant blush. | You\'ve met many a warrior, but rarely one with the particular skillsets of a pit fighter such as %name%. All the clashing in the arenas has made him a clever warrior indeed, and also one with many a scar and injury to match his time there. | There\'s many pairings in this world, and a gladiator with an untouched body is not one of them. %name% is a skilled fighter, but he earned those experiences with his own blood and body. | An impressive gladiatorial resume such as the one %name% brings hints at a man well versed in killing. The many scars, however, flatly state that his time in the pits came with an irreversible price of their own. | Gladiators such as %name% could be the most skilled fighters in all the land, but the fighting pits are full of games and are designed to bring harm to all who partake. The man is a talented warrior, but he wears the scars and wounds of a career in the arena.}";
