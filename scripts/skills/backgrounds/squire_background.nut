Alarm bells met their moans and an hour later half of %townname% lay in ruin. | While traveling, brigands attacked his lordship\'s wagon-train. Swords were drawn, heads were halved, and when it was all said and done the squire had failed: everyone he was supposed to protect lay dead. | But one evening a horde of ferocious, furred creatures came down upon his lord\'s keep. In desperation, %name% let a group of prisoners free, hoping they would aid him in combat. Instead, they slew his lordship and ran off into the night. The squire, bravely, managed to survive, a dozen husky corpses at his feet, but the battle left him alone and without purpose. | Angered by a horrible crime in %townname%, he took matters into his own hands, personally slaying the criminal. A just act, but also an improper one. The young squire was banished for his insubordination. | When a devilish red knight came to %townname% for a duel, %name%\'s knight proved far too sick to fight. After downing a mug of liquid confidence, %name% donned his lordship\'s armor and faced the red knight himself. With a sword slash so fast it rang the very air, %name% slew his opponent down.} {Now there was only one task left for him - to attain knighthood. | Now the squire seeks the company of good men with which to again prove himself worthy of being a knight. | As war ravages the land, there is now plenty of opportunity to put his skills to use. | Though a bit too earnest, there is no doubt the world needs men like %name%.}";
