Sturdy, resolute, hard-working. | With food so needed, there\'s little wonder why farmers are the most common sort of man in all the land. | A farmer hates to see his land fertilized in blood, but that\'s becoming more and more common these days. | In war, farms are hotspots for armies. Not just to feed themselves, but to recruit from the stable of strong men who work those lands. | As cities grow and distance themselves from the hinterland, citizens often forget to whom their full bellies owe gratitude.} %name% {is a burly, sweat-sculpted farmhand. | hails from the outskirts of %randomtown% where he drove ploughs and broke horses. | knows a couple kinds of hoes, all of which the farmhand can swing with ease. | grew up on one of the land\'s many farms. | spent many years harvesting the crops that feed everyone in the land. | worked as a farmhand for a simple homestead. | fell into farming after his boating business went under. | became a farmhand to help feed his dozen kids and two wives. | took up farming as a means to a belly-filled end. | carries the stocky frame best used for planting, harvesting, and surviving winters.} {Unfortunately, it didn\'t take war and turmoil long to find his farm. | But poor harvests have driven him from the farms. | Sadly, his farm was one of the first to be attacked during these trying times. | Word of coming violence, however, drove him from the peaceful vocation of farming. | Droughts, poorly-timed as ever, have now driven the man from his work. | Unpaid for his labor, he eventually abandoned the farm life. | With more crowns than ever in the killing businesses, the man was easily drawn away from his motley crops. | One day, he realized his strong body had more value chopping heads than milking cows. | After raiders pillaged his crops, he\'d had enough, leaving the farm life for good. | After the weather soured his harvest, the farmer decided to choose a vocation not wholly based on the whims of Mother Nature. | Word has it he really did sleep with the farmer\'s daughter. What a surprise he\'s no longer on the farm.} {Cornfed and barnbred, %name% stands before you as fit a man you\'ve ever seen. | He misses the cows, true, but %name% should take to the mercenary\'s tough life with ease. | Growing up on a farm gives a man all the nutrients he\'d ever need, and %name% certainly took advantage. | %name% once took a mule kick to the face. Its foot broken, they had to put the animal down. | If men were trees, %name% would never fall down. Or something gracious like that. | Don\'t let his simple past fool you, %name% could fit right in with any wrestler or fighter. | %name% shares a lot in common with draught animals. Just point him the right way. | Judging by his size, there must have been a lot of meat in that corn %name% spent all his life eating. | %name% is big enough to wring a guy\'s neck like it was a cow\'s udder.}";
