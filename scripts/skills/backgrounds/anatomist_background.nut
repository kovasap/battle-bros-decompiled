Yet, here he is, rather shrewdly grounded and looking over his shoulders. | Like many anatomists, %name% went out on his own into the world. Of course, also like many, he was quickly chewed up by the hungriness of those to whom science means nothing. For now, he will fight alongside sellswords, if only to buy himself extra time to truly get to his studies. | %name% is cynical to the world, upset that some of his peers could see to their education in full, while he must earn coin just to support his studies. May his anger present itself on the battlefield. | One would expect a man like %name% to appear after a battle, not actually participate in it. The fact such an intelligent, albeit bizarre figure would still need a sellsword\'s earnings has you wondering if your own prospects of getting anywhere in this world are even worse than you realized. | One cannot overstate %name%\'s intellect. He is a wicked smart man, the sort who can make you question why the gods bothered to give you a mind of your own if it is to be so dwarfed. But, in sellsword matters, he would be just another fighter. Hopefully his martial skills are as sharp as his wits. | You can never know for certain if it were hard times which forced %name% into sellswording, or if he\'s merely pursuing scientific inquiries by another, far crueler path. That he spends evenings dissecting wagon-crushed dogs and wingless butterflies makes you ponder a lot of things about the curious fellow. | Curiosity, not coin, brought %name% to sellswording. He has a keen interest in discovering the creatures of the world, and what they look like on the inside. So long as he makes said insides visible, you could care less what else he does with them.}";
