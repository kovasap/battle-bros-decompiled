The mailman seeks a new field of work. | Carrying love letters, the would-be adventurer wondered what the hell he was doing. | Claiming to be a budding hero, %name% now believes the task of delivering mail is beneath him. | Rain or sunshine, sure, snow or sleet, sure, but all out war? Maybe another time. | But after opening a letter that would ruin a goodhearted noble, the messenger decided to leave his post. | When robbers made his life hell, %name% figured he\'d be better off traveling in the company of armed men. | After sleeping with a mayor\'s wife, the messenger had a small army on his heels. He figured he\'d best slip into a different outfit for his own safety.} {%name% has spent years memorizing messages. Now he\'ll have to remember keeping the shield wall as arrows rain down on it. | Ironically, %name% has never written anything in his life. | Rolling up his sleeves, %name% boasts he has one last message to give the world. Everybody look out. | Perhaps his joining mercenaries suggests that, indeed, the pen is not mightier than a sword. | %name% has a tendency to repeat everything said to him. Old messenger habits die hard. | Ironically, the well-traveled messenger has probably seen more horrors on the road than most of the men in the outfit. | Few, if any, of %name%\'s skills make him ready for combat. But he does have some sturdy legs, hopefully just not for running away.}";
