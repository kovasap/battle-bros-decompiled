It\'s a horse! A horse! %scholar% sighs heavily before marching off to the beat of endless profanity. Personally, you thought it was a crab. | You find %scholar% standing over %dumbguy%. Count the beetles, don\'t smash them, the learned man says with exasperation. %dumbguy% looks down at his beetle-juiced hands where {fragments of insect carapaces | carapaces of once-insects} dot his flesh.

It appears they\'re at a very red-faced crossroads. %dumbguy_short% says he doesn\'t care if he\'s dumb, and the %scholar_short% argues that every man should be learned. Well it appears %dumbguy_short% would prefer to be left to his devices for he shows %scholar_short% his back as he walks away. Guess that\'s the end of the lesson for both men. | You find %dumbguy% squatting beside a creek, staring at himself in the shimmering reflection. He must have been at it for a while now for he\'s showing signs of sunburn. You ask if everything is alright, to which he explains that he is not \'getting it\' with %scholar%\'s teachings, and that %scholar% nearly went mad today before finally giving up on the venture. You explain that %dumbguy% doesn\'t have to be smart, he just needs to know how to swing a sword and shoot a bow. That\'s what you hired him for, after all. The man tries to hide a smile, but the running water betrays him. You take him back to camp where you then tell %scholar% to lay off for a while.}",
