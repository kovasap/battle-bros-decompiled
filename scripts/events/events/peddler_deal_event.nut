All he needs now is a bit of money to get him started and help purchase the goods. A sum of 500 crowns all in all. Naturally, as a partner, you will get a cut of the profits once it\'s all said and done.",

Settling down, the man hands over a heavy purse of coins, stating that it is your cut of the profits.\n\nBefore you can even say anything, the man wheels on his heels and jumps away, giddy with his success.",
