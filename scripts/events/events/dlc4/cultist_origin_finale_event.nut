You are happy to have passed.\n\n%sacrifice% unbuttons his shirt and %cultist% pierces his chest as though he were putting a key into a lock, and he twists it all the same. The sacrifice gasps and tenses, for no devotion to Davkul can put aside the manner in which death may be permitted, which is in pain and suffering. But he smiles, and the light doesn\'t so much go out of his eyes as the darkness, a sort you haven\'t seen before, replaces it. And like that, he is gone.\n\n %cultist% gets to work on the still warm corpse, carving the flesh with rapid slices across the skin and hard cuts into the tendons. He pulls the chest apart. A black fog lingers with the blade\'s every move, and it seems to sway cheerily after its every move. When %cultist% is done, %sacrifice% has been turned into a slab of armor, flesh torn asunder and stretched, teeth for rivets, tendons for strappings, bones for pauldrons, a cuirass of absolute carnage.
