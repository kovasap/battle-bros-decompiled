The shop owner then came after him with a broom, trying to shoo the man out of his store. Believing the broom a monster, the wildman proceeded to go completely crazy. Judging by the reports, it was quite the commotion, up to and including shite throwing.\n\nNow the shop owner is in your face demanding compensation for the damage done. Apparently he\'s wanting %compensation% crowns. Behind him, a few town militia stand with very watchful eyes.",
